#  A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a "bootstrap" context, which is a parent context for the main application.
#  Out of the box it is responsible for loading configuration properties from the external sources,
#  and also decrypting properties in the local external configuration files.
#  The two contexts share an Environment which is the source of external properties for any Spring application.
#  Bootstrap properties are added with high precedence, so they cannot be overridden by local configuration, by default.
#
#  The bootstrap context uses a different convention for locating external configuration than the main application context,
#  so instead of application.yml (or .properties) you use bootstrap.yml, keeping the external configuration for bootstrap and main context nicely separate.
